Overview
========

This application uses QR codes and the [Treasury REST API] to receive and make payments with digital cash.

Spend money without worrying about identity theft or credit card fraud. This application acts as the 
"wallet" in a protocol that allows you to conduct worry-free transactions in-person or via the Internet 
by securely trading a token that is worth exactly what you say it's worth and is valid for one-time use. 
Imagine this token as a dollar bill that is worth exactly what you owe. No personal information to divulge, 
no account data to exploit. Just cash in hand.
